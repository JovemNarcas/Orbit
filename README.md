<h1>Orbit: Lightweight jQuery Slider</h1>
<p>Orbit is a jQuery slider developed by ZURB. The plugin is lightweight(4KB), easy to implement and has a good set of features. 

<h3>jQuery Orbit Plugin 1.4.0</h3>
<p>
This version is no longer supported, but as this plugin is so simple to use and lightweight, I thought it couldn't die,
I made the necessary changes to run with jQuery v3.4. +, I hope it helps those who still use this little pearl.
